{"name":"KerbalAPI","body":"### KerbalAPI\r\nIn its 0.14 release, [Kerbal Space Program](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/) added a class loader, enabling us to write custom functionality into the game. Yay! Unfortunately, KSP is written on top of Unity, and there's very little separating the two. The KSP classes are built in the Unity style, with obscure interactions between class fields.\r\n\r\nThe goal of KerbalAPI is to roll as much functionality as possible into a dedicated API that does _not_ sit on top of Unity.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git checkout git@github.com:KerbalAPI/KerbalAPI.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Project Status\r\nDevelopment of KerbalAPI is presently suspended, but please contact me if you're interested in the project.","tagline":"Modding API for Kerbal Space Program","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
